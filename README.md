Dataset Description:
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

Here is a brief overview of the dataset:

Number of observations: 11,159
Number of variables: 16
File type: CSV (Comma Separated Values)
